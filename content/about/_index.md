    Aaron and Allie Thiel are of the "see a need, meet a need" mindset motivated by a desire to serve. They are driven to love people well and leave their little slice of the world, Kaukauna, WI, better than they found it. With a focus on forging relationships within the community, their vision clearly sees the human potential and opportunities for innovation in the Fox Cities. 


    As the spark grows to a flame, Aaron and Allie are inspired by the continued forward progress of downtown Kaukauna as it continues to grow into a bustling hub of small businesses serving a local and global market. Part of their mission is to ensure Electric City Properties community partners have the space to dream big, incubate new ideas, and collaborate with other like-minded entrepreneurs across a broad range of disciplines and work experience. This is how big things come out of small places, and we're ready to get after it!
